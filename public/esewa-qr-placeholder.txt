PLACEHOLDER FOR ESEWA QR CODE

Instructions:
1. Generate your eSewa QR code from your eSewa merchant account
2. Save it as an image file (PNG or JPG)
3. Place it in the public folder as: public/esewa-qr.png
4. Update src/app/orders/[id]/payment/page.tsx to use the actual image

The payment page currently shows a placeholder. Replace the placeholder div with:

<Image
  src="/esewa-qr.png"
  alt="eSewa QR Code"
  width={256}
  height={256}
  className="mx-auto"
/>

Make sure to import Image from 'next/image' at the top of the file.
